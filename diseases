"""Podcasts"" are just pre recorded lectures. That terminology was confusing. ""Mandatory"" shouldn't be used for every single lecture, because clearly they
were not mandatory. That was misleading."																				
"Classifying all lectures as ""MANDATORY"" was an unfortunate decision. Many of us prefer to have the ability to change lecture pacing (1.5x), have the ability to pause and review a short section, or learn at a time when we are best able to concentrate. I would suggest changing this to be only for the TBL/CBLs
where interaction is critical to learning."																				
Communication about self study modules and changes in lecture schedule did not occur or was delayed.																				
Communication required work. The "self‐study" modules were not discussed in the intro lecture and caused a lot of confusion. Some of the lectures were listed "mandatory" attendance when they required no team‐based learning and were strictly lectures (so why are they mandatory then??).																				
"I think communication was overall functional but within the Rheum portion it would be nice to have been clearer about the Self Studies. I would have preferred that they just be additional lectures and denoted as such. Furthermore, for Derm, I think specific references to what aspects of a disease need to
be known would be helpful (or lists with classic characteristics)"																				
"I think this could use quite a bit of work. Finding the lectures in the self‐study modules was not as easy as it should be and took some time. I just think they
should explicitly be posted on the calendar."																				
"lectures were not posted on time, numbering of lectures was changed too many time to keep track of, the definition of ""mandatory"" was not made clear
until halfway through the block."																				
Lots of changes with the scheduling and what lecture was actually happening when																				
More correspondence regarding required material not covered in lecture would help for future classes!																				
my understanding was that there will not be a lot of Pharm questions on the test but it was very pharm heavy. Please better communicate this in the future																				
NA																				
No communication about "self‐study lectures," communicated the date of exam review AFTER the exam review had already started.																				
Overall I think communication was very strong during the course																				
Some of the sessions that were designated as mandatory/compulsory did not have to be labeled as such in my opinion.																				
The calendar could have been better lots of last minute changes.																				
"The course was really poorly managed and communicated and managed in general. It made success difficult to manage that the Rheum portion was such a mess. Derm lectures could have used some more words‐a rare statement but more of the descriptors we're exxpected to use included in the slides so that
the things we dont manage to write are still there for reference!"																				
This course is a perfect example of how not to run a medical school course. Communication was lacking and unclear.																				
We were unaware of when the final review was until it was happening. Advanced notice would have been appreciated.																				
canvas organization could be improved, the calendar was not well utilized. self lectures as a concept were confusing.																				
Canvas schedule did not have functional link to take me to the respective materials for lectures.																				
Canvas was a mess. It was extremely difficult to find the materials. Lectures and "self study" weren't accessible from the calendar. Lecture recordings cut   off. There was also a lecture that did not have slide labels ‐ the lecturer would say "yes" to something that was said in the audience, then would not repeat it into the microphone, so it was impossible to know what the correct diagnosis was when watching the recorded lecture.																				
Dermatology was extremely well organized but rheum lectures (especially the infection one of the joint could use a bit more organization)																				
Good organization of content.																				
i do like the rheum derm split and i think the material was presented in a good order																				
I think the self‐study modules were a bit confusing. The organization of some of the slides was also a bit confusing.																				
it was a bit hard to follow the calendar on canvas, including what was mandatory vs. depth material ‐the pdf of the ARDD schedule was most helpful ‐color‐ coding the sessions for lecture vs. case‐based sessions vs. depth material (as was done for wk 2 derm) made it easier to follow ‐it would also make it easier if naming was consistent (ex: labelling all case sessions as "case based learning" vs. calling some "TBLs" etc. ) ‐also, i downloaded the drug list during wk 1, but   i noticed it was later edited & more "red drugs" were added afterwards, but I didn't get an announcement about the changes.																				
It would be helpful to have more complete summaries of diseases.																				
I've no qualms about the organization of the material that we learned, although I have to admit, the 2‐3 back‐and‐forth lectures on rheumatoid arthritis vs. spondyloarthropathy confused me a bit. I would have preferred just one lecture on RA, and another lecture entirely on SpA, and that'd be it.																				
"lectures were always up late. very hard to find where PDFs/recordings were. required a lot of extra work. poorly organized. other courses in the past have
not had this issue, perhaps contact those people and see how to improve this."																				
no at home lectures																				
Organization was good, though it would be nice if the calendar was linked to the modules																				
"Please number the lectures to improve organization. It is also difficult to keep track when some are hidden in self‐study modules. I would suggest
numbering all testable lectures, including those in the ""self‐ study"" portion."																				
See above.																				
Self study lectures should just be made actual lectures. No need to hide material we're responsible for under an ambiguous module.																				
"Self study modules are absurd. The ""podcast"" style is ineffective and should just be a full lecture. Please find time in the schedule for this rather than making
students give up their other time."																				
Self Study modules should have been separate lectures																				
Some canvas mishapsâ€¦ also, self study lectures are not very nice																				
some of the lecture slides especially from Derm had no descriptions. just a picture of a rash which makes it confusing when reviewing. or there were IHC images that had no descriptions. adding a sentence of what the lecturer is trying to convey with the figures would be useful																				
"The canvas calendar was objectively on the lower end with regard to organization. One main thing that would help is if lecture recordings and slides were
linked to the calendar, as is the case for most other courses."																				
"The canvas page was very disorganized and the difference between lectures and ""podcasts"" (please don't call them podcasts) and ""expert sessions"" was not
clear."																				
The canvas page was very hard to navigate. Please, for the love of all that is good and holy, number the lectures!!! It is so hard to keep track of where we  are at (and to organize our own notes) when there is no clear order to the lectures. Add to that a confusing message mid‐ course that was, I think, supposed to clarify, and this course made my brain hurt. The content is hard enough. Please don't add to the difficulty of this course by making it hard to navigate.																				
"The organization of the course was very poorly done. Lectures weren't numbered which made it hard to make sure you had studied them in all in your notes. Lectures and slide decks weren't posted til right before the lecture time or sometimes after the lecture time. The self study lectures were so weird. It made it harder to budget my time accordingly when not all the lectures were on the schedule. Very confusing I constantly felt like I must be missing
something"																				
The self‐study modules should be their own lecture modules.																				
"There was a problem with many of the lectures being cut off/ not scheduled correctly on canvas. Additionally, the self study modules were not explained
well and could have been incorporated into lecture material"																				
"This is the first class where the module information (like the slides etc) were not populated on the canvas calendar events. It was mildly frustrating but also
very small in the grand scheme of things."																				
"WAY too many Rheum lectures (there absolutely should not be self study modules). For derm, content was well organized but because it was taught right
before the text it didn't stick in people's head as well."																				
"Would prefer to have a clear understanding of the course set up on Canvas prior to the course‐ many of us were unaware of what was and was not
mandatory from the self‐studies until after the rheumatology portion of the block was over."																				
Greatly appreciated the review lectures.																				
Itâ€™s unacceptable that the recordings of the lectures are cut off because they run over.																				
Lecture flow and style made sense & coordination																				
lectures worked well together and were in a logical order.																				
self study lectures has to be the terrible idea . we are in medical school to learn from lecturers and slides....																				
Some lecturers covered the exact same topics unnecessarily																				
The CBL cases were really helpful to connect different lectures.																				
The ordering of the lectures made little sense. Additionally, the "self‐ study" lectures were just cruel. Distance learning is not an excuse to add more content that you weren't able to schedule appropriately. It felt very disrespectful of our time. If you need more lecture slots, lengthen the course.																				

"A lot of the slides were just huge blocks of text and poorly formatted at that which is truly the worst way to present information. The best lectures were the
ones with lots of pictures, diagrams, case studies"																				
definitely learnt a lot.																				
I felt the Rheum lectures were incredibly dry and felt more like instructors reading slides than teaching																				
I really think the rheum pharmacology lecture for this block needs to be completely re‐done. Bring back Dr. Brandl if possible, but if not, the slides need to be redone, there needs to be more discussion on the side effects of the medications and why they are a problem, etc.																				
"I relied heavily on outside resources and group study to make it through this course. I honestly don't think I would have passed if I solely relied on the course
content alone."																				
I thinking providing more background for the diseases would be better instead of just facts.																				
Overall, it was sufficient, but there could definitely be some improvements during the earlier week. The lectures could use a lot of work. Specifically, lecturers reading lines of bullet points (not even indented/organized bullet points) feels like listening to a textbook being read. These lectures could be better organized to facilitate learning, and honestly, derm did a nice job of providing better examples of that.																				
"Pharmacology lecture was all over the place. Need much better pharm content than a subpar lecture and telling us to ""read the drug list"" which is 16 pages
of text."																				
"Really appreciated the VA derm clinic afternoon! Would make more sense for this to be scheduled during the derm block when students have learned derm,
rather than scheduled during the rheum block."																				
Rheum lectures were very confusing and had LOTS of unnecessary info on the slides. For drugs, I'd love if Brandl taught the drugs.																				
TBL's & CBL's were super useful!																				
TBLs/CBLs were most helpful!																				
The derm portion was incredibly well taught.																				
"The lectures did not emphasis the same material as the exam or board materials. I studied board materials thoroughly and they were extremely different
than what was expected in the course."																				
The majority of the course consisted of black text on white slides, which is incredibly boring and difficult to be engaged with																				
The pharmacology lecture/teaching method could be improved																				
Too many recorded lectures in the rheum section. Made it feel like we were back in online school.																				
While I might not entirely agree with how the course was structured at times, everything I learned here I feel would be clinically useful in my career!																				

"Review" sessions presented some new material which was on the exam.																				
Compared to other exams we've had, this one was much more difficult and some questions felt like they were beyond what the course emphasized.																				
Could have been more relevant to the key concepts. Not all information was weighted equally. Difficult to know what to study (specifically with derm)																				
"Details that were not given attention during lectures did end up on the exam. This did not affect the ability to pass the exam in a significant way but was
surprising to myself and other students."																				
"Exam (ESPECIALLY DERM) was testing EXTREMELY low yield facts. Asking what we thought the bug was based on a pic of the bug, the stain of an infection,
these were all things that were BARELY mentioned. The high yield content of derm was barely any part of the test. in addition, the fact that it's only 20 questions makes it way too hard to pass derm."																				
"Exam questions were random and arbitrary. One of the most poorly written exams I've taken in medical school. I think it could've reflected lecture and
content much much better. Also completely irrelevant to boards materials."																				
Exam tested more on nitty‐gritty low‐yield details than on high yield broad clinical concepts.																				
"Felt that the exam focused on minor details that weren't really emphasized as important during lecture, or were just quickly brushed over (like the question
about identifying the bug, for example)."																				
I find it frustrating to have course blocks where the sole Pharmacology lecture is presented as a "self‐study podcast", and yet is so heavily emphasized on exams. This has happened for multiple blocks. I understand the presentation of therapeutics early on so we can be familiarized as we go through the succeeding disease content, but the pacing of the block is so fast that repetition of this content is necessary. It's not enough to just throw a slide up on therapeutics after the presentation of each disease. I would be able to distinguish treatments more if we had a CBL/TBL dedicated on pharmacology at the end of the block, or a review lecture. Brandl would be great to understand the nuances between the different biologics, and also for understanding the differences in dosing for corticosteroids. The exam was somewhat fair, however I felt like some of the knowledge was very hit or miss (for example, requiring us to recognize the image of a bed bug insect instead of the manifestation of a cutaneous infection of this insect, the latter of which was the lecture theme).																				
i wish we had some more practice questions on the cutaneous manifestations of systemic disease (some portions of the derm exam didn't seem to highlight material we mastered/reinforced in CBLs and/or quizzes; rather it included examples we saw once in lecture)																				
lot of factoids																				
"Many of the questions seemed to be on statistics that were not emphasized appropriately during the lecture. For example, the questions concerning the
exact percentage of blood cultures that come back positive in patients with cellulitis."																				
"Much more nitpicky than I thought, focused less of big picture and more on gotcha statistics and details. Pharm material was also not well communicated,
aside from a supplementary 15 page table."																				
N/A																				
Overall I feel that the questions were rather poorly written and tended to focus on discrete facts as opposed to an emphasis on high‐yield applications of principles. Along with this, I don't feel that dermatology was at all represented to the extent that it should have been. Also, for the amount of emphasis on vasculitis that this course had, I would have expected more questions on the exam. A lot of this exam seemed to center on biologic therapy, which in practice makes sense, but if the goal of this exam/course was to prepare us for STEP and know high yield topics, I think the exam failed to do so. At the very least, a summative lecture on biologic therapy and overall treatment heuristics for rheum diseases would have been helpful.																				
Overall the exam was very fair. A few curveball questions but very fair overall																				
Quizzes were very representative of exam questions.																				
"The exam contained minute details and did not reflect major takeaway points. It was not equally distributed between the lectures. Way too much emphasis was put on pharmacology when that was only one lecture. As a student who spent much time studying board materials and disease manifestations, it was
barely useful for the course exam."																				
"The exam had a big emphasis on statisticsâ€¦ I just wish it focused more on the clinical management of the diseases and not the esoteric stats that we could
look up."																				
"The final exam content was not at all what I was anticipating, based on the lecture content, CBLs/TBLs, and Quizzes 1 & 2. I felt like the content did not align
with what we had been practicing."																				
"The rheum portion felt reflective but the derm section felt much out of proportion to the quiz. Also focused significantly on small minutia that did not seem
emphasized in lecture or CBL"																				
there were a lot of questions about epidemiology of disease that were not as emphasized in the material																				
There were multiple questions on obscure topics or topics not discussed in the course.																				
There were some questions on epidemiology that were too granular.																				
"Ultimately, this exam felt as if it tested very low yield content that was not inherently emphasized by our lecturers. Further, the review lectures were much
further from comprehensive than other blocks."																				
While I appreciate the importance of the epidemiology of the diseases we discussed in this course, it felt like some test questions were pretty lazy in the sense that they would ask (for example) "which of the following is true" and then test our knowledge of five completely random, unrelated facts. There is no critical thinking involved in these types of questions, just straight recall, and I'm not sure they accurately represent our understanding of course material.																				
could revisit lecture slides and make them more readable, rather than just blocks of test.																				
Derm was superior than Rheum in both content presentation and facilitated teaching. Rheum TBLs were the only positives of that section.																				
Fun material. I liked the course. Very much enjoyed the Derm POM day. maybe TBLs could be better																				
Greatly enjoyed the course & feel I learned a lot in the process																				
I enjoyed the course and do not have any major complaints. I liked to clinical nature of it. The one thing I thought could be improved were some of the test questions. I thought it focused a bit too much on minor details relative to some other block exams. Also there were some questions where the question stem had nothing to do with the answers. I remember there being a question (details fuzzy) that started out with a 30 y/o patient who was going to be put on NSAIDs and which adverse reaction is true, and the answer was about an adverse reaction happening more often in patients over 70 y/o.																				
"I felt like the dermatology portion of the course was excellent and very well organized. However, the rheum part of the course was at times hard to follow. I
wish there had been more practice with the drugs, it was difficult to keep track of the various treatment algorithms in terms of what order to administer certain regimens."																				
I really enjoyed this class and found the content to be very well taught and interesting; unfortunately, I didnâ€™t feel the exam fairly gauged what I learned. It felt like the exam had a lot of â€œtrickâ€Â questions about inconsequential details that werenâ€™t emphasized.																				
I really like the CBL discussions on the Rheumatic diseases. The dermatology portion is also very interesting. However, I prefer a more organized way of scheduling lectures. The self‐study lectures should just be displayed outside as a part of the normal schedule. I dont mind having multiple subject/longer lectures. The self‐study portion is hidden and makes it hard for student to keep tract. The infectious disease lecture has multiple pictures without explanation or label so it is hard to follow. Overall, thank you so much for the learning opportunity and I really enjoy this block.																				
If there was any way to avoid having lectures that are not accounted for in our schedule, that would be great.																				
"Interesting course, I do feel like I learned a lot of dermatologic vocabulary and got sufficient practice at using this language. The arthritis types were also
relatively well explained, and I liked the classification of them into separate modules. Could've used more pharmacology practice, and more quizzes on image recognition for derm, though I appreciate the links to outside resources."																				
It might be helpful to include labels for dermatology slides, not just photos, so that we know what we are looking at as we study on our own.																				
It was good, but I wouldn't say "excellent"																				
It was well organized. The most helpful sessions were CBL cases and review session.																				
One of the most stressful blocks in my opinion. Most students were really scared going into the test because it's hard enough to have 2 different topics being covered but for both of those to be tested in a disorganized way, then it makes it very difficult for us to master these concepts.																				
Pharmacology in rheum was poorly taught.																				
"Possibly would be better taught with immunology as a combined block and removing dermatology. Dermatology perhaps could be taught as a one week
block or with the pertinent diseases they relate to. skin structure is taught in histology, anyway."																				
Really enjoyed dr terkeltaubs lectures â€” really great clinical correlations on how to apply rheum in real life																				
The hidden study lectures were frustrating.																				
There is a specified amount of time in our schedule for lectures. Having â€œself‐studyâ€Â lectures to do on top of that shouldnâ€™t be allowed. We have so much to do already. Those topics need to be fit into the dedicated time slots by cutting extraneous lectures. Pharmacology could be better explained.																				
This course desperately needs a rework.																				
"Would have liked a comprehensive lecture tying in concepts from derm + rheum (where do these overlap clinically / what is collaboration like between
these specialties)"
